# UI App Starter Kit

This repository serves as a template for kickstarting a new UI app built with React, TypeScript, Redux, React Router, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint configuration.

## Features

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors and improve code maintainability.
- **Redux**: A predictable state management library for managing complex application state.
- **React Router**: A routing library for declarative navigation and routing in React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- **ESLint**: A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and TypeScript code.

## Getting Started

To create a new UI app using this starter kit, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Use this template" button at the top of the repository to create a new repository based on this template.
2. Clone the newly created repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redacuve/ui-starter.git
```

3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
cd ui-starter
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see your app running.

## Folder Structure
The project structure follows a standard convention for organizing React applications:

- **src/**: Contains the main source code of the application.
  - **components/**: Contains reusable UI components.
  - **pages/**: Contains components that represent individual pages or views.
  - **redux/**: Contains Redux-related files (actions, reducers, store).
- **App.tsx**: The main entry point of the application.
- **index.tsx**: The entry point for rendering the React app.
- **public/**: Contains static assets (HTML file, images, etc.).
Feel free to modify the folder structure to suit your needs as the project grows.

## Configuration and Customization
**ESLint**: The project comes preconfigured with ESLint for code linting. You can customize the ESLint rules by modifying the .eslintrc.json file.

**Tailwind CSS**: The project is set up to use Tailwind CSS for styling. You can customize the theme and add or modify utility classes in the tailwind.config.js file.
